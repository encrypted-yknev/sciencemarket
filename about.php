		<span>Nash Rochman, Co-founder</span></br>
		<p class="abt-section">
			Nash holds a PhD in Engineering from Johns Hopkins and balances his interest in basic science with his desire to work on projects that can be easily appreciated by a general audience. He also loves playing Jazz trumpet and wishes that that too could be more easily appreciated by a general audience.

	<div class="caption-content">
		<span>Nicolas Perez, Co-founder</span></br>
		<p class="abt-section">
			Nico has a diverse network of collaborators in the biotech private sector, the maintenance of which draws heavily from his infectious personality. Nico is also a salsa dancing instructor which coupled with his relaxed charm is validating many South American stereotypes across the Eastern seaboard.

		<span>Ikbal Chowdhury, Co-founder</span></br>
		<p class="abt-section">
			<i class="quotes"></i>
			Ikbal has a passion for medical device development and currently holds a patent for a cuff-less blood pressure measurement tool, but web development is a close second in his heart. Ikbal is a citizen of the world with cologne from Dubai and refined rejection of American croissants from Paris.

		<span>Venkateshan N, CTO</span></br>
		<p class="abt-section">
			Venky has worked on many projects in numerous languages and is an invaluable asset for the ScienceMarket team. He is quiet and mysterious, but based on his usage of the letter &apos;u&apos; there is some speculation that the UK might have played a significant role in his past.
